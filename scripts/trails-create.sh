Remains of trellises evoke another era, when trains were popular for personal travel and for the transport of goods. Now and then, the wooded trail offers glimpses of the reservoir, which dams the Deerfield River. The town of Harriman became deserted over time and now lies at the bottom of the reservoir, after having been flooded when the dam was built. The railroad bed is wide and flat, with a short section of single-track. Beginners can take the railroad bed south to the spillway, a nice place for a lunch break, and then retrace their steps back to the start for a total of 14 miles.
